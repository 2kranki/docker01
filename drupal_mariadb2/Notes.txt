# This was an investigation of combining drupal and a mariaDB as a docker-compose
# multi-container application.  It is from Docker Mastery at udemy.com.  The
# original problem called for using postgre instead of mariaDB, but I wanted a
# little experience using mariaDB (a fork of MySQL).  This assignment has a 
# twist from the prior one in that we want to preload twitter's bootstrap into
# drupal which requires us to build a drupal container with it in it.

# So, I started out looking at the docker hub pages for drupal and mariab.  Since
# I had not worked with drupal before, I also read their wikipedia page,
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal
# Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal
#        and: https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb

# I took the yml file from the previous exercise and copied it here.  I used his
# notes to create the docker file and work on the yml file.  My big mistake was
# that initially I pointed all the volume references to one volume.  When drupal
# started, it did not have read/write ability for a couple of its files.  I checked
# what he did and he had each one to a separate volume.  I corrected my yml to do
# the same and everything then worked. I asked about it and the reply was
# "when docker mounts a volume on container start, that volume temporarily overwrite
# the directory and anything below it, so if you try to do a single volume at the 
# root of drupal, then files that need to be there won't be, and drupal will fail. 
# Drupal requires that you create new volumes just for the specific directories that 
# contain persistent/unique data."  So, now I know why it didn't work.

# So, the CLI commands from this directory are:

        docker-compose up
# This left it attached to my terminal and I could watch all the log message. Then,
# I started a browser for: http://localhost:8080
# answered all the questions and bingo, drupal was running!  Woohoo!
# To shut it down, I did:
        ^C (Ctrl-C)
        docker-compose down -v
# The -v gets rid of all the volumes that were created and I was done.  If you 
# leave off the -v, the data will be retained and you will not have to go
# through the initialization process again.
