# This was an investigation of combining drupal and a mariaDB as a docker-compose
# multi-container application.  It is from Docker Mastery at udemy.com.  The
# original problem called for using postgre instead of mariaDB, but I wanted a
# little experience using mariaDB (a fork of MySQL).

# So, I started out looking at the docker hub pages for drupal and mariab.  Since
# I had not worked with drupal before, I also read their wikipedia page,
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal
# Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/_/drupal
#        and: https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb

# From those, I was able to start developing the yml file.  I knew that this would
# only be a yml file exercise. Since I had already done one yml file and the doc from
# above, I was able to pretty much piece together the rest of it.  So, the CLI
# commands from this directory are:

        docker-compose up
# This left it attached to my terminal and I could watch all the log message. Then,
# I started a browser for: http://localhost:8080
# answered all the questions and bingo, drupal was running!  Woohoo!
# To shut it down, I did:
        ^C (Ctrl-C)
        docker-compose down -v
# The -v get rid of the volume that was created and I was done.
