Misc Docker projects

Enclosed are my Dockerfile builds that I use.

mssql_loaded - A copy of Microsoft SQL Server that I modified to load my test databases after starting.  I am taking a course from udemy on Docker and this was a fun project.  I had learned to do it via a bash file from outside the container, but this loads the databases from inside the container.
