                            Golang Docker Container

You can find the documentation on the Golang Docker container here:
    https://hub.docker.com/_/golang

Golang is a Google developed programming language.

There are several commands that you will want to learn to use the container. First
is:
    docker image pull golang:latest

This adds the golang container image to your local Docker images. Once, you will
need to analyze the documentation to see what you want to make it do.  You should
note that the container does nothing and terminates without being given commands
as in documentation examples.
